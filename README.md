TASK 1: I developed a dynamic and interactive To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on user experience and functionality. This project was designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks by providing features such as task creation, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as completed.

*Key Features:*

1. *Task Management:* Users can add new tasks with details like name, date, time, and location. The application allows users to edit and delete tasks easily. Tasks that have been completed can be marked with a checkbox, providing a visual indication of their status.

2. *Form Validation:* The application includes form validation to ensure that all necessary fields are completed before a task is added. If a user tries to submit a task with any empty fields, an alert prompts them to fill in the required information.

3. *Responsive Design:* The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes. This ensures that the To-Do List is accessible and easy to use, whether on a desktop or a mobile device.

4. *Data Persistence with Local Storage:* The application utilizes Local Storage to save tasks, ensuring that users' data persists even after the page is refreshed. This feature guarantees that tasks are not lost and can be accessed later, providing a reliable way to manage tasks over time.

5. *User Interface Enhancements:* The UI is enhanced with CSS, including gradient backgrounds, hover effects on buttons, and dynamically changing styles for tasks that are past their due dates, which turn gray to indicate expiration. Additionally, the main content area has a hazy effect, providing a modern and visually appealing design.

6. *JavaScript Functionality:* JavaScript is used extensively to handle user interactions, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as updating the UI based on user actions. The use of event listeners, DOM manipulation, and condition-based rendering highlights the effective use of JavaScript in creating an interactive application.

This project demonstrates my ability to build a fully functional web application, manage client-side data storage, and create an intuitive user interface that enhances user engagement and task management.
